# The potential change on Land Surface Temperature during the diurnal cycle produced by changes on Land Cover Classes


## Monitor:
EU-land-based mitigation potential impact tool

This monitor assess local climatic impacts of land-based mitigation strategies involving land cover changes, such as tree planting or ecosystem restoration, by estimating the potential change in local surface temperatures based on a combination of satellite remote sensing datasets.
